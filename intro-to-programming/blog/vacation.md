# Favorite Vacation Destination

Recently, my partner Krista and I were able to visit Hawai'i. The timing was perfect for us. We had just had some devastating family news, so we were able to recover and process during this trip. Additionally, we had a babysitter for our 1.5 year old, which let us enjoy the trip <code>more as adults and less as parents</code>.

The trip was paid for by the company I work with, [Puppet](http://puppet.com). I gained a spot for this trip by **overacheiving** our team sales goals. Thankfully for us, they spoiled us greatly and allowed us to choose activities that allowed us to relax and also enjoy the beautiful areas around us.
